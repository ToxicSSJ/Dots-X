# Dots-X
Final project of first semester in EAFIT University (Programming Fundamentals), winner of a GEMIS award.
Dots-X is a game based on the famous Android or iOS Dots, this time it was made in Java through the JavaFX library.

# Introduction
This game is made in the JavaFX library, where it is used as the main one for the two versions, also it was made in the Java 8 version. For the game was asked to make two versions, the console version and the graphic version, both are explained in two segments in this repository to help understand how it works. It should be noted that the game was developed in the **Spanish** language, so all the texts will be in that language.

# Console Version
This version, is the most complete, works quite well, has only been tested on Windows and Mac, in addition to that must be borne in mind that to run perfectly the terminal must have support for special characters.
> Note: The console uses the ANSI Colors format to work correctly.

## **Console: Infinite Mode**

Same as the original, only it is infinite and to finish playing you must press the number 2.

## **Console: Bomber Mode**

 This mode is like Bomberman style, now there is a chance that a bomb will appear and when you touch it during a sequence it will remove all the cross dots, and if it hits another bomb it will also explode, doing a chain reaction. It is infinite too.
